RegExpBuilder v1.0
=============
RegExpBuilder integrates regular expressions into the programming language, thereby making them easy to read and maintainable. Regular Expressions are created by using chained methods and variables such as arrays or strings. It is not a major abstraction that tries to change regular expressions into something else - all of the concepts of regular expressions are represented by RegExpBuilder.
